# Snake-Game
Basic Snake game with instance high score and space bar reset of game coded in javascript
The game acts as regular snake game following the tutorial here (https://www.educative.io/blog/javascript-snake-game-tutorial). 

The only changes from the original tutorial is that the game can be reset anytime using the space bar which allows for repeated play after the game has ended without having to reload the page. The added reset option also allows for the page to keep track of the high score since the page was loaded.

The code uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript
